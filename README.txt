    TBD: Explanations
    
**  Scenario
    
    TBD    
    
**  Setting up a new CA
    
      | $> u-pki ca new MyCA
      |
      | CA has been initialized. Now change directory to 'MyCA' and
      | run 'u-pki ca new-key <days>' to generate a new CA key which
      | is valid <days> days. Optionally link 'inbox' and 'outbox'
      | directory (e.g. to an USB stick).
      | 
      | $>
        
      | $> cd MyCA
      | $> emacs CA/CA.cnf
        
      > commonName       = <<insert email or ident text here>>
      > emailAddress     = <<insert email address here>>
      > organizationName = <<insert organization name here>>

      > commonName       = Frobnicate CA
      > emailAddress     = ca@frobnicate.no
      > organizationName = Frobnicate Inc
    
      | $> ln -s /media/usb1 inbox
      | $> ln -s /media/usb1 outbox
      | $>
    
    
      | $> u-pki ca new-key 4000

      | Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
      | ...............+++
      | ......................................................................+++
      | writing new private key to 'CA/CA_Frobnicate-Inc_20090823_003411.key'    
    
    
**  Setting up a new organization
    
    
      | $> u-pki org new MyOrg
      |  
      | Org has been initialized.  You should now edit Org/Org.cnf.
      | Optionally link 'inbox' and 'outbox' directory (e.g. to an USB
      | stick).

      >     
      > commonName          = <<insert email or ident text here>> # only when defining entity
      > 
      > # 0.subjectAltName  = ...
      > # 1.subjectAltName  = ...
      > 
      > emailAddress        = <<insert email address here>>
      > organizationName    = <<insert organization name here>>
      > 

      > 
      > commonName          = <<insert email or ident text here>> # only when defining entity
      > 
      > # 0.subjectAltName  = ...
      > # 1.subjectAltName  = ...
      > 
      > emailAddress        = info@argoonics.no
      > organizationName    = Argoonics Foundation
      > 

      | $> ln -s /media/usb1 inbox
      | $> ln -s /media/usb1 outbox
      | $>


**    Creating a new entity and requesting keys (Org) 
    

      | $> u-pki org new-ent www
      |
      | Entity www has been created.  You should now edit
      | Ent/www.cnf.

    
    
      > 
      > commonName          = <<insert email or ident text here>> # only when defining entity

      > # 0.subjectAltName  = ...
      > # 1.subjectAltName  = ...
      >
    
      > 
      > commonName          = www.argoonics.no
      > 0.subjectAltName    = forum.argoonics.no
      > 
    
      | $> u-pki org new-req www
      | Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
      | .......++++++
      | ........++++++
      | writing new private key to 'keys/Argoonics-Foundation_www_20090823_005242.key'
    
      | $> u-pki org send

**  Signing keys (CA)

    
      | $> cd MyCA/

      | $> u-pki ca receive
    
      | $> u-pki ca sign-all
      | 
      | Check that the request matches the signature
      | Signature ok
